## Active Issues

### Priority Issue: Dashboard-new.md Blank Panels
- 🔴 Issue: Dashboard-new.md shows blank panels despite successful data loading (7889 sequences)
- 🔴 Root cause: Visualization initialization tied to cache loading instead of direct D3.js rendering
- 🔴 Temporary workaround: Use Shift+Alt+F keyboard shortcut or debug panel button to force initialization
- 🔴 Permanent fix: Implementing direct D3.js visualization on initialization (see doc/plan.md)
- 🔴 Status: Plan created, implementation in progress
