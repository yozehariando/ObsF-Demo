## Known Issues Being Addressed
- Progress bar animation sometimes stalls ⏳
- Large datasets cause rendering lag 🔜
- Similarity connections can be hard to see with many points 🔜
- Job status updates can be delayed 🔜

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
- 🔜 Add advanced filtering and sorting options for similar sequences
- 🔜 Implement embedding visualization for detailed analysis
- 🔜 Add sequence export functionality
- 🔜 Optimize performance for large datasets
- 🔜 Enhance visualization with animations and tooltips

## Pending Features Tracking

The following features from the original plan are still pending implementation:

### High Priority Items
- ⏳ Toggle between geographic and UMAP views in the map component
- ⏳ Create similarity panel showing top matches
- ⏳ Add sequence comparison view
- 🔜 Implement embedding visualization for detailed analysis

### Medium Priority Items
- 🔜 Add API configuration panel for customizing API requests
- 🔜 Implement visualization controls (zoom, filter, etc.)
- 🔜 Create help tooltips for complex features
- 🔜 Add filtering and sorting options for similar sequences

### Performance Optimizations
- 🔜 Implement progressive loading for large datasets
- 🔜 Add pagination support for the 'all' endpoint
- 🔜 Use web workers for processing large datasets
- 🔜 Implement tiered caching strategy

### Advanced Features
- 🔜 Create export and sharing functionality
- 🔜 Add advanced statistical analysis tools
- 🔜 Implement history of analyzed sequences
- 🔜 Enable saving/loading of analysis results

### Long-Term Goals
- 📋 Use WebGL for hardware-accelerated rendering
- 📋 Implement request batching for multiple API calls
- 📋 Add background refresh of cached data
- 📋 Create detailed evolutionary analysis tools
