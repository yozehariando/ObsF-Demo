## Known Issues Being Addressed
- ✅ Progress bar width styling issue fixed
- ✅ TypeError in job tracker when status method is missing resolved
- ⏳ Job status synchronization across components
- ⏳ Handling multiple concurrent jobs
- 🔜 Large datasets cause rendering lag
- 🔜 Similarity connections can be hard to see with many points
- 🔜 Job status persistence between page refreshes
- ⏳ Similar sequences visualization uses potentially inaccurate coordinates
- ⏳ Missing coordinate lookup for similar sequences by accession number
- ⏳ Inconsistent highlighting behavior between UMAP panels
- ⏳ Unwanted auto-scrolling in details panel when highlighting sequences

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
- 🔜 Add advanced filtering and sorting options for similar sequences
- 🔜 Implement embedding visualization for detailed analysis
- 🔜 Add sequence export functionality
- 🔜 Optimize performance for large datasets
- 🔜 Enhance visualization with animations and tooltips
