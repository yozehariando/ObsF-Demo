- **Time-based Visualization**: Show the spread of sequences over time

### User UMAP Refinements
- Enable uploading multiple FASTA files (maintain upload button after completion)
- Add Reset button to clear all uploaded FASTA files
- **Bi-directional Cross-UMAP Highlighting**: 
  - When a sequence in the User Sequence UMAP panel is clicked, highlight the corresponding sequence in the Reference Database UMAP panel
  - Remove auto-scrolling behavior in details panel
  - Focus interactions between the two UMAP panels, not with the mutations details list
  - Ensure clear visual feedback when sequences are highlighted across panels

### User Interface Refinements
- Improve job tracker styling for better visibility
- Add animation transitions between visualization states
- Polish tooltip formatting and content
- Enhance error messages with more specific guidance

### Job Status & Progress Tracking Refinements
- **Progress Bar Animation**: Fix animation with more reliable DOM updates and transitions
  - Use direct DOM updates for critical progress bar state
  - Ensure progress bar updates even if job tracker component changes
  - Fix "width" styling issues that previously caused stalling
- **Job Status Synchronization**: Enhance status updates between components
  - Fix TypeError in `setupJobPolling` when accessing job tracker methods
  - Add job status persistence between page refreshes using localStorage
  - Implement retry mechanism for job status API failures
  - Add graceful error recovery for orphaned jobs
- **Multiple Job Handling**: Properly manage multiple concurrent jobs
  - Add unique identifier tracking for each job
  - Implement job queue system for handling multiple uploads
  - Fix DOM element conflicts when multiple jobs run concurrently

### Performance Refinements
- Optimize UMAP data loading with chunked responses
- Implement memory management for large datasets
- Add render optimization for scatter plots with many points
- Optimize similarity calculations with spatial indexing

### Similar Sequences UMAP Visualization Refinements
- **Scientific Accuracy Improvements**: Ensure similar sequences are correctly positioned in UMAP space
  - Match similar sequences to the UMAP data cache using **only accession numbers** from metadata
  - Only display sequences with real, verified UMAP coordinates in the visualization
  - Never generate artificial coordinates for similar sequences without real UMAP data
  - Clearly distinguish between sequences with and without UMAP coordinates in the interface
- **Cache Enhancement**: Improve sequence matching in the UMAP data cache
  - Create an efficient lookup index for the UMAP data cache by accession number
  - Implement a fast search algorithm to find exact accession matches
  - Add clear visual documentation explaining that only sequences with real coordinates are shown
  - Include coordinate source information in metadata tooltips
- **Interface Improvements**: Better handle sequences without UMAP coordinates
  - List sequences without UMAP coordinates in the Mutations Details panel only
  - Provide clear visual indication of which sequences have UMAP coordinates
  - Add filtering options to focus on sequences with available coordinates
  - Ensure the user understands why some sequences aren't displayed on the UMAP

### Refined Similar Sequences Workflow

The correct workflow for handling similar sequences is as follows:

1. **Upload sequence** (via `/pathtrack/sequence/embed` endpoint)
   - User uploads FASTA file
   - System returns job_id for tracking

2. **Poll job status** (via `/pathtrack/jobs/{job_id}` endpoint)
   - Check status every few seconds
   - Continue until status is "completed"

3. **Get UMAP projection for user sequence** (via `/pathtrack/sequence/umap` endpoint)
   - Use job_id to fetch UMAP coordinates
   - Place user sequence on UMAP visualization

4. **Get similar sequences** (via `/pathtrack/sequence/similar` endpoint)
   - Use original job_id to fetch similar sequences
   - Similar sequences contain metadata with accession numbers, but no UMAP coordinates

5. **Match similar sequences to UMAP coordinates**
   - Use accession numbers from similar sequences to lookup coordinates in UMAP data cache
   - UMAP data cache comes from the `/pathtrack/umap/all` endpoint
   - Only show sequences on the UMAP visualization if coordinates are found
   - List all similar sequences in the Details panel regardless of coordinate availability

This workflow ensures scientific accuracy by only displaying sequences with real UMAP coordinates while still providing users with a complete list of similar sequences.

### FASTA File Requirements

User-uploaded FASTA files should conform to the following specifications:

- Standard FASTA format with sequence header lines starting with ">"
- Support for both nucleotide (DNA/RNA) and protein sequences
- Recommended maximum file size: 5MB
- Single or multiple sequences per file (multiple sequences will be processed as separate jobs)
- Header line format: should contain identifier information that can be parsed
- Example of a valid FASTA sequence:

```fasta
>NZ_QTIX00000000 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain XDR1219, South Africa
ATGCCGCGTGAGTGATGAAGGCTTTCGGGTCGTAAAACTCTGTTGTTAGGGAAGAACAAGTGCTAGTTGAATA
AGCTGGCACCTTGACGGTACCTAACCAGAAAGCCACGGCTAACTACGTGCCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACGTAGG
TGGCAAGCGTTGTCCGGAATTATTGGGCGTAAAGCGCGCGCAGGCGGTTTCTTAAGTCTGATGTGAAAGCCCA
CGGCTCAACCGTGGAGGGTCATTGGAAACTGGGGAACTTGAGTGCAGAAGAGGAAAGTGGAATTCCATGTGTA
GCGGTGAAATGCGCAGAGATATGGAGGAACACCAGTGGCGAAGGCGACTTTCTGGTCTGTAACTGACGCTGAT
GTGCGAAAGCGTGGGGATCAAACAGGGATT
```

These FASTA files are processed through our embedding pipeline to generate embeddings, which are then used for similarity search and UMAP projection.
