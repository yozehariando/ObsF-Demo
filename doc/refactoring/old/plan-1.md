# Dashboard.md Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for breaking down the large dashboard.md file into smaller, more maintainable modules. The goal is to improve code organization, readability, and maintainability without changing functionality.

## Important Note on Original File

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** During the refactoring process, we should NOT modify the original `dashboard.md` file. This file serves as our reference implementation and should be preserved in its original state. 

If any bugs or issues are discovered in the original implementation:
- Document them in `doc/implementation-plan.md`
- Fix them ONLY in the new refactored implementation (`dashboard-new.md` and module files)
- Do NOT backport fixes to the original `dashboard.md`

This approach maintains a clean separation between the reference implementation and our refactored code.

## Visualization Component API Lessons

During the refactoring process, we've identified critical lessons about visualization component APIs:

1. **Multiple Method Variations**:
   - Components might expose either `updateScatterPlot`, `updateData`, or both
   - We must handle all possible method variations for compatibility
   - Always verify method existence with `typeof component.method === 'function'`

2. **Element Selection Strategies**:
   - Direct element selection (`getElementById`) is more reliable than chained lookups
   - Always verify elements exist before operating on them
   - Clear elements before recreation to avoid conflicts

3. **Initialization Timing**:
   - Components may need initialization before data is available
   - Initial rendering should not wait for cache loading
   - Always implement fallbacks for when initial rendering fails

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Every visualization function needs robust error handling
   - Use multi-layer fallbacks when errors occur
   - Create direct D3.js visualizations as ultimate fallback
   - Log detailed debugging information at each step

5. **API Compatibility**:
   - When refactoring, maintain backward compatibility with existing component APIs
   - Document expected method signatures and return values
   - Implement API adapters where necessary

These lessons have been incorporated into our fixes for the blank visualization issue, resulting in a more robust and reliable dashboard implementation.
